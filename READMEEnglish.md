## HANGFIRE

Hangfire is an open-source library for scheduling background tasks in .NET applications. It allows developers to schedule tasks to run at a specific time in the future, or at regular intervals, without the need for manual management of thread or process scheduling.

It was created to handle situations where tasks need to be executed asynchronously and outside the context of the HTTP request in web applications, such as long-running processing, bulk email sending, report generation, among others.

## Concepts
### Recurring Jobs
Recurring Jobs are tasks scheduled to run at regular intervals. For example, we can schedule them to run every hour, week, or day... Recurring jobs in Hangfire enable you to automate processes that need to be executed repeatedly in your application."
